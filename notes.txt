Components are the building blocks of any React app and 
a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, 
a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally
accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element
that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

RCC- classical look lol 
RFC- functional component

Class component- // State you need to use class based components 
    // or use life cycle hooks-for events with data-forms for example
whenever you are extending a class-it has functions you need to bring 
in ---you must use the super key word it tells the constructor to bring
it in and gives it access to it(go to parent class component class--bring
it all in)

What is super () in JavaScript?
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's 
parent. The super.prop and super[expr] expressions are valid in any 
method definition in both classes and object literals.
